# Bloxorz
Implementation of Bloxorz game on Kotlin

The goal of the game is to move a little block of size 1x1x2 units by toppling and rolling it over a terrain with a complex shape. When the block falls off the terrain, you lose (and have to start the same level again).

This project is based on http://otfried.org/courses/cs109/project-bloxorz.html

To run the program, you will need to move cs109.jar and cs109ui.jar files (author: Otfried Cheong) to the Kotlin's lib folder.

To play this game, you also need to compile (i.e. type in the terminal `kts bloxorz.kt`) and run (i.e. type in the terminal `kt BloxorzKt`) the bloxorz.kt file.

Use R, L, U, D to control the block.

This game has 9 levels
